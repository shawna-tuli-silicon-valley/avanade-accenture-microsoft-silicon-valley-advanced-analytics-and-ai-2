"I recommend Shawna for her exceptional leadership and dedication during the UC Irvine Capstone course in Spring 2023.

Shawna's unwavering commitment to sourcing a comprehensive dataset for predicting energy demand in California underscores her diligence. This effort laid the foundation for an AI-driven product vision with a community welfare focus. Her data science expertise was pivotal in verifying student progress on a sprint basis and providing timely feedback.

Notably, Shawna's adept student management skills shine. She skillfully combines challenge and support, even offering assistance on weekends. Her structured schedule and regular touchpoints guided students to success, embodying invaluable mentorship and support.

Shawna's impact extended beyond the initial program goals. She played a crucial role in elevating the program by collaborating with Accenture team members to develop a draft version of a manuscript for journal submission. Her proactive contributions and collaborative approach exemplify her commitment to excellence." - Vishrut Chokshi (Accenture Los Angeles Senior Manager, Data Science Enablement & Delivery Lead)

"Shawna brings great enthusiasm, problem solving and creativity. These capabilities combined with her drive to add value make Shawna a high performer in complex situations." - Manish Dasaur (Accenture North America Chief Data & Analytics Officer, Communications & Media)

"Shawna,

As you know, I am the Office Managing Director of Southern California and have worked with you on the Data Science / Applied Intelligence Capstone Program at University of California, Irvine. You played a major role in working with the students, documenting the work and leading most of the effort. This program takes a lot of coordination and planning, and you did a great job. I appreciate that you are very active in supporting the Avanade and Accenture brand on LinkedIn and that you do it in a very professional and effective way.

I was surprised to find out that you are not a Manager - based on all my interactions I thought you were a Manager!

Shawna - thanks for all you do and have a great rest of the summer!" - Marty Hodgett (Accenture Southern California Managing Director) 

"I worked with Shawna as a mentor at UCI Data Science Capstone project on Predicting Risk of Type II Diabetes in California with AI. I was impressed with her exceptional communication skill and her eagerness to assist students. She was dedicated to answering students' questions and provided insightful responses. Also, her mentorship and coordination skills have undoubtedly contributed to the success of the team, which resulted in the project being published. In addition to her professional expertise, she consistently exhibits a friendly, patient, and unwaveringly positive demeanor. I was honored to have this great opportunity to collaborate with Shawna." - Mei-Chi Chen (Accenture San Francisco Software Engineer)

"Shawna is an excellent mentor and communicator. She is a highly skilled and experienced professional with a deep understanding in data analytics and consulting. She is also a gifted communicator.

On our school project, Shawna helped us to choose the best model for our project. She also helped us to manage our time effectively and to communicate effectively with each other. As a result of her guidance, we were able to complete our project on time and to a high standard.

In addition to her technical skills, Shawna is also a great mentor. She is patient, supportive, and always willing to help others. She is also a great communicator and is able to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise way.

I have no doubt that Shawna would be an asset to any team. She is a highly skilled and experienced professional with a strong work ethic and a positive attitude." - Nima Hendi (University of California, Irvine Data Science Graduate)

Her high level of responsibility and commitment to the project truly make her a valuable manager. Without a doubt, I would eagerly choose to work with her again in the future." - Frank Dong (University of California, Irvine Math & Data Science Graduate)

"Everyone talks about "culture add" but it is often the first thing that gets sacrificed when looking for the right hire. Shawna is a rare "culture add" that has brought a deeply analytical mind and love for data to Avanade but also a sense of community, inclusion, and support for the kind of workplace we've strived to build. I would recommend you consider her for any of your teams you're not just trying to make better but make great." - Harry Holstrom (Avanade West Region Territory Lead for Communications, Media and Technology)

"I am so glad I had the opportunity to work with Shawna on a project that helped me and my team to gain very useful insights! We worked together to analyze reports that had an overwhelming amount of information. Before Shawna was brought on, the task was stressful and daunting. As soon as Shawna got involved, she was able to bring her vast expertise to simplify, problem solve, and help me in a matter of days with analysis that without her would have taken me months. Shawna is not only an expert at what she does, but is also approachable, friendly, and willing to take the time to help you understand why and how things work. Shawna is quite simply impressive and very talented, and I sincerely hope I get the chance to work with Shawna again!" - Maggie Hillding (Avanade West Business Development Lead) 

"I had the pleasure of working with Shawna to stand up our Accenture engagements at our alma mater - the University of California, Irvine. I was highly impressed by her strong work ethic, executive presence, and ability to drive her initiatives end-to-end. She mentored multiple UCI students through the Capstone course, where I had the honor of seeing the final product of their work. Needless to say, the outcome of their work was nothing short of outstanding.

Starting something new from scratch is never easy, but Shawna made working together painless. She was always the first to lend a helping hand to whoever needed it and was always receptive to feedback from the team. 

If I could work with Shawna in every single one of my engagements, I would (and it would be good advice for you too)." - Jeff Lu (Accenture Los Angeles Management Consulting Consultant)
