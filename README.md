"Shawna,

As you know, I am the Office Managing Director of Southern California and have worked with you on the Data Science / Applied Intelligence Capstone Program at University of California, Irvine. You played a major role win working with the students, documenting the work and leading most of the effort. This program takes a lot of coordination and planning, and you did a great job. I appreciate that you are very active in supporting the Avanade and Accenture brand on LinkedIn and that you do it in a very professional and effective way." - Marty Hodgett (Accenture Southern California Managing Director) 

"I worked with Shawna as a mentor at UCI Data Science Capstone project on Predicting Risk of Type II Diabetes in California with AI. I was impressed with her exceptional communication skill and her eagerness to assist students. She was dedicated to answering students' questions and provided insightful responses. Also, her mentorship and coordination skills have undoubtedly contributed to the success of the team, which resulted in the project being published. In addition to her professional expertise, she consistently exhibits a friendly, patient, and unwaveringly positive demeanor. I was honored to have this great opportunity to collaborate with Shawna." - Mei-Chi Chen (Accenture San Francisco Software Engineer)

"I got to work with Shawna on my most recent code migration project and her professionalism and commitment to this project were very valuable. I would recommend Shawna for any of your IT projects." - Bridget Menzer, PMP, SA (The NPD Group New York Senior Project Manager)

"Shawna is an excellent mentor and communicator. She is a highly skilled and experienced professional with a deep understanding in data analytics and consulting. She is also a gifted communicator.

On our school project, Shawna helped us to choose the best model for our project. She also helped us to manage our time effectively and to communicate effectively with each other. As a result of her guidance, we were able to complete our project on time and to a high standard.

In addition to her technical skills, Shawna is also a great mentor. She is patient, supportive, and always willing to help others. She is also a great communicator and is able to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise way.

I have no doubt that Shawna would be an asset to any team. She is a highly skilled and experienced professional with a strong work ethic and a positive attitude." - Nima Hendi (University of California, Irvine Data Science Graduate)

"Shawna is a great manager for my capstone project California Energy Prediction. She effectively introduced the scope of our work for the entire project and provided us with a comprehensive timeline as a reference. Throughout the project, our communication with Shawna was excellent. She responded promptly to our requests and efficiently coordinated meeting times. Her high level of responsibility and commitment to the project truly make her a valuable manager. Without a doubt, I would eagerly choose to work with her again in the future." - Frank Dong (University of California, Irvine Math & Data Science Graduate)

"Everyone talks about "culture add" but it is often the first thing that gets sacrificed when looking for the right hire. Shawna is a rare "culture add" that has brought a deeply analytical mind and love for data to Avanade but also a sense of community, inclusion, and support for the kind of workplace we've strived to build. I would recommend you consider her for any of your teams you're not just trying to make better but make great." - Harry Holstrom (Avanade West Region Territory Lead for Communications, Media and Technology)

"I am so glad I had the opportunity to work with Shawna on a project that helped me and my team to gain very useful insights! We worked together to analyze reports that had an overwhelming amount of information. Before Shawna was brought on, the task was stressful and daunting. As soon as Shawna got involved, she was able to bring her vast expertise to simplify, problem solve, and help me in a matter of days with analysis that without her would have taken me months. Shawna is not only an expert at what she does, but is also approachable, friendly, and willing to take the time to help you understand why and how things work. Shawna is quite simply impressive and very talented, and I sincerely hope I get the chance to work with Shawna again!" - Maggie Hillding (Avanade West Business Development Lead) 

"I had the pleasure of working with Shawna to stand up our Accenture engagements at our alma mater - the University of California, Irvine. I was highly impressed by her strong work ethic, executive presence, and ability to drive her initiatives end-to-end. She mentored multiple UCI students through the Capstone course, where I had the honor of seeing the final product of their work. Needless to say, the outcome of their work was nothing short of outstanding.

Starting something new from scratch is never easy, but Shawna made working together painless. She was always the first to lend a helping hand to whoever needed it and was always receptive to feedback from the team. 

If I could work with Shawna in every single one of my engagements, I would (and it would be good advice for you too)." - Jeff Lu (Accenture Los Angeles Management Consulting Consultant) 

"I worked with Shawna directly on multiple initiatives such as increasing UCI recruitment efforts at Accenture as well as the submission of our BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care article.

Highly recommend working with Shawna if given the opportunity!" - Jeffrey Vu (Accenture Los Angeles Senior Analyst)

I would highly recommend working with Shawna if you ever have the chance." - Ella Liang (Accenture San Francisco Management Consulting Analyst)
