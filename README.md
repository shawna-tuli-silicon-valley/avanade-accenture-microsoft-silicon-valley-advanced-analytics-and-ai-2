"Everyone talks about "culture add" but it is often the first thing that gets sacrificed when looking for the right hire. Shawna is a rare "culture add" that has brought a deeply analytical mind and love for data to Avanade but also a sense of community, inclusion, and support for the kind of workplace we've strived to build. I would recommend you consider her for any of your teams you're not just trying to make better but make great." - Harry Holstrom (Avanade West Region Territory Lead for Communications, Media and Technology)

"I am so glad I had the opportunity to work with Shawna on a project that helped me and my team to gain very useful insights! We worked together to analyze reports that had an overwhelming amount of information. Before Shawna was brought on, the task was stressful and daunting. As soon as Shawna got involved, she was able to bring her vast expertise to simplify, problem solve, and help me in a matter of days with analysis that without her would have taken me months. Shawna is not only an expert at what she does, but is also approachable, friendly, and willing to take the time to help you understand why and how things work. Shawna is quite simply impressive and very talented, and I sincerely hope I get the chance to work with Shawna again!" - Maggie Hillding (Avanade West Business Development Lead) 

"I had the pleasure of working with Shawna to stand up our Accenture engagements at our alma mater - the University of California, Irvine. I was highly impressed by her strong work ethic, executive presence, and ability to drive her initiatives end-to-end. She mentored multiple UCI students through the Capstone course, where I had the honor of seeing the final product of their work. Needless to say, the outcome of their work was nothing short of outstanding.

Starting something new from scratch is never easy, but Shawna made working together painless. She was always the first to lend a helping hand to whoever needed it and was always receptive to feedback from the team. 

If I could work with Shawna in every single one of my engagements, I would (and it would be good advice for you too)." - Jeff Lu (Accenture Los Angeles Management Consulting Consultant) 

"I worked with Shawna directly on multiple initiatives such as increasing UCI recruitment efforts at Accenture as well as the submission of our BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care article. Throughout all of my experiences, Shawna has always been a a pleasure to work with. She stays organized, manages responsibilities beautifully, and communicates effectively. Highly recommend working with Shawna if given the opportunity!" - Jeffrey Vu (Accenture Los Angeles Senior Analyst)

"I have the pleasure of working with Shawna in the UCI x Accenture Engagement and Recruiting team and love the energy that she brings to the team! She is a capable leader and is dedicated to her role. Shawna is patient and thoughtful and does a fantastic job driving a project from beginning to end with great success. I would highly recommend working with Shawna if you ever have the chance." - Ella Liang (Accenture San Francisco Management Consulting Analyst) 

“Shawna is working at Google for our team as a Sr. Consultant from Accenture. Her work always went above and beyond. She has a knack for providing clear data insight to help make critical business decisions. Her presentation style is always easy to understand and digest. Our team continues to work with her for ongoing projects and she keeps on delivering over and above expectations.” - Abhishek Lal (Google Technical Program Manager)
